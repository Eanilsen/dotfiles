* Interviews
- It was important to determine which functions was needed/wanted by the different users/actors of the system.
- One person from each field.
- Good feedback
- Prioritized Even L. because of his role as product owner and lecturer in the subject.
* User Stories
- Created through an iterative process.
- Based on several different aspects.
- Project specifications
- interviews
- Discussion with other students/teachers
- Group discussion as students
- Group discussion as developers
- Several iterations. Firs set of user stories was created during the pre-sprint and sprint 0.
** Two different formats
1. As a <role> I want <functionality> so that <some benefit>.
2. In order to get <some benefit> as a <role> I want <functionality>.
** Criterias
- Relevant functionality
- Relevant sources. (Potential users)
- Development capability and timeframe. Aim realistically.
- Should be unique.
** MoSCoW
- Voted with all members present
- Turned out to be more time consuming than productive
- Group agreed.
- Time contstraints and the structure of the lectures (maybe experience?)
- Did not use MoSCoW for the last iteration of user stories.
* Use Cases
- More abstract description based on the user stories
- Illustrates real world scenarios
- Building the bridge between the formal description of the US and the more
abstract presentation in other diagrams
- Analyse structure and requirements
- Fulfill the users, buyers and the developers needs
** Iterative process
- Adapted according to the user stories
