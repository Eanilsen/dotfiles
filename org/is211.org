  Data structures: Handling data in programs
  Algorithms: How to carry out useful operations on the data structures
  Analyzing algorithms: Find the properties of algorithms


  How do we measure the efficiency of an algorithm?

  The code examples in the book might be over engineered
  - Measure time
  - Count loops

  log10(10) = 1
  log10(100) = 2

  O(log n) very fast
** Tuition and exercises
   - 2 hours of lectures per week
   - Mandatory exercises
   - 4 hour written exam
  
** Big-O
   T(n)~O(n^2)
